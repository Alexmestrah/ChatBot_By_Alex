Greetings,

This project introduces a Python-based chatbot designed for user interactions. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries and deep learning techniques,
the chatbot provides intelligent responses to user queries.

To get started, download all the files to your local machine and then run "interface_main.ipynb". Once the execution is complete, an interface will appear on your desktop,
representing the chatbot. You can ask it questions, and it will provide you with responses. Additionally, you have the option to train the chatbot to enhance its capabilities.

In the "data.json" file, you'll find the dataset used to train the bot. Note that the dataset includes information from my CV and details about deep and machine learning.
However, you can also customize the training data by placing your own datas directly in the file while maintaining the same ".json" file structure.
